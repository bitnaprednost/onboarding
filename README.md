// TODO: fix previous days based on Igor's review

# Day 01
- I kind of overdid this task with Strategy and Decorator pattern, it was unnecessary for the task, but kind of did it for practice, after day 01 I stopped doing it.
- ChatGPT help: advised to use combination of Strategy and Decorator pattern, main focus was on anticipating potential new algorithms for calculating sums.

# Day 02
- ChatGPT help: advised me to create Bag and Game classes

# Day 03
- ChatGPT help: just reminded me that records exist in Java, no further help

# Day 04
- ChatGPT help: just used it to turn raw input into Java Maps instead of manually writing it.

# Day 05
- ChatGPT help: just some refactoring idea after I completed the 2nd task. Needs refactoring, especially Range class.
- Perhaps make fillBlanks() and similar methods public instance methods and AlmanacWithRanges should call it to define what to do with ranges?

# Day 24
- ChatGPT help: just asked it to give me a formula for the intersection point of 2 lines if only the slope and 1 point is known, asked it to generate more test data
